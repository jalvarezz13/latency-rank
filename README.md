## ❓ What is LatencyRank?

LatencyRank is a lightweight client-side application that allows you to test, measure, and compare the network latency of multiple domains, IPs, endpoints, or URLs.

It performs multiple requests directly from the client to each target, measures the latency of those connections, and generates a ranked list showing which endpoint responds the fastest from your current location.

This helps you make informed decisions when choosing DNS providers, servers, endpoints, or domains based on real-world latency rather than assumptions.

## ⭐ Features

- Accepts a list of:
  - Domains
  - IP addresses
  - Endpoints
  - Any valid URL
- Executes multiple requests to each target from the client side
- Measures and aggregates latency results
- Generates a ranking based on lowest latency
- Highlights the closest and fastest option from your location

## 🚀 Use cases

- Selecting the fastest API endpoint
- Comparing DNS providers
- Choosing between multiple CDNs or servers
- Performance testing from different locations
- Troubleshooting latency issues
